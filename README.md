# White-bear-web-editor
Java editor for www.white-bear.cz 

This is a standalone editor for my website www.white-bear.cz which allows "word-like" writing and generates HTML5 code which is then 
uploaded onto the server. It automatically checks SEO for title, alt, and other html tags and attributes. It is capable of 
inserting images and converting them to the desired sizes for use on the website. It allows the user to completely prepare an
article in the editor and then upload the resulting html file onto the server.

TODO: Generate HTML from article, validate result, upload using FTPS with SSL certificate.
